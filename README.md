# Surprise Housing Regression Project
> Surprise Housing, a US-based company specializing in data-driven property investments, is planning to enter the Australian real estate market. The company aims to identify and purchase houses at prices below their actual market values, then sell them at a higher price for a profit. To facilitate this, Surprise Housing has collected a dataset from house sales in Australia. The goal of this project is to build a regression model using regularization techniques to accurately predict the actual values of prospective properties. This model will assist the company in making informed investment decisions and ensuring profitable transactions in the new market.
